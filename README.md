Objective:
Address the growing issue of cyberbullying and hate speech by developing a model to detect and classify tweets with negative sentiments, particularly focusing on identifying racist and sexist content.

Problem Statement:
Hate speech, including racist and sexist tweets, has been a persistent issue on social media. The goal of this project is to classify tweets as hate speech if they exhibit racist or sexist content, distinguishing them from other tweets. This classification will help in filtering out harmful content and contribute to a safer online environment.

Dataset Overview:
The dataset includes:

train.csv: 31,962 labeled tweets (used for training and validation).
test.csv: 17,191 unlabeled tweets (used for testing the model's performance).
Task Roadmap:

Data Preprocessing:

Load and explore the dataset.
Clean the tweet data by removing unnecessary elements like URLs, mentions, special characters, etc.
Tokenize the text and convert it to a suitable format for model training (e.g., using TF-IDF or word embeddings).
Handle class imbalances in the dataset using techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or data augmentation if necessary.
Model Building:

Choose suitable machine learning or deep learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or advanced techniques like LSTM or BERT.
Train the model on the labeled data in train.csv to classify tweets as racist, sexist, or neither.
Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Model Tuning & Validation:

Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model for the best performance.
Validate the model using a split of the train.csv dataset or k-fold cross-validation.
Testing:

Test the final model on the unseen test.csv dataset to evaluate real-world performance.
Analyze and interpret the results, focusing on the accuracy of detecting hate speech.
Deployment & Monitoring:

Deploy the trained model as a web service using frameworks like Flask or Django.
Provide a user-friendly interface to input tweets and get real-time predictions of hate speech.
Monitor model performance and adapt to changing patterns in hate speech over time.
Outcome:
A robust classifier capable of identifying racist and sexist tweets, contributing to efforts in filtering out harmful online content and ensuring a safer social media environment.
